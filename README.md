# Edit-User-Interface
This is a code to change USER Interface by user runtime of the application. 

After opening the app the user can see a button at the top named Edit. 

After tapping on the button the button will be changed to "Done". 

Now the user can swipe any UI element like label, text field, image view by the finger. 

Once the user satisfies with the new outlook of the user, can press "Done" button. 

Now the UI element cannot be moved. 

Again if the user wants to change the position of the UI element, have to press "Edit" button.

Objective C Code:- 
In this Objective C code "accessibilityValue", "protocol", "UIGestureRecognizer" have been used.
